# Efficient-Learning-of-Fuzzy-Logic-Systems-for-Large-Scale-Data-Using-Deep-Learning

Matlab implementation of the following paper:

```
A. Koklu, Y. Guven, T. Kumbasar, 2024. Efficient Learning of Fuzzy Logic Systems for Large-Scale Data Using Deep Learning, International Conference on Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems.
```
We kindly ask that to cite the above mentioned paper if you use type-1 / type-2 fuzzy layer functions and you publish papers about work that was performed using these codes.

Before utilizing the code, ensure that the corresponding "lib" files for both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic systems (T1-FLS and IT2-FLS) are added to your MATLAB path. Additionally, please ensure that you correctly adjust the paths for the datasets according to your directory structure.

This repository will be updated to include any new methods published in the future.
